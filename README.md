# AusEnergy Energy Demand Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the AusEnergy Energy Demand Analysis project repository! This project focuses on understanding energy demand patterns in Australia, a critical aspect of efficient energy supply management. We have analyzed historical data to answer key questions related to energy demand fluctuations over time, extreme demand scenarios, and the influence of weather and holidays.

## Project Contents

- **Data Analysis Workbook:** You can explore our data analysis in detail using our Excel workbook. It includes various worksheets with insights on energy demand, weather impacts, and year-to-year comparisons.

- **Presentation:** In addition to the analysis, we've prepared a PowerPoint presentation introducing essential data analysis tools, including Tableau, databases SQL, and Python. Learn how these tools can enhance data insights and management.

## Getting Started

To explore our findings and the presentation, simply download the project files and open them with the respective software tools (Excel for the workbook and PowerPoint for the presentation).

## Presentation Structure

Our presentation is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction (5 minutes):**
   - Brief overview of the project and analysis approach.

2. **Analysis (10 minutes):**
   - Energy demand patterns over time.
   - Extreme demand scenarios.
   - Impact of weather and holidays.
   - Comparison of demand in different years.

3. **Further Work (5 minutes):**
   - Tools to enhance analysis.
   - Data lifecycle and potential areas for DataSpace assistance.

4. **Discussion (5 minutes):**
   - Q&A session with the project team.
